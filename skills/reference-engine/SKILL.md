description: Use when building ANYTHING - the universal reference-first system that routes every task to proven reference implementations instead of generating from assumptions. Covers API design, database schemas, testing strategies, CI/CD pipelines, code patterns, DevOps, and any other domain where professional reference implementations exist
---

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
This is the meta-protocol that governs ALL reference-first behavior. If you are building something and no domain-specific reference protocol exists, this protocol IS your reference system.

YOU MUST LOCATE A REFERENCE BEFORE YOU BUILD. NO EXCEPTIONS.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

# Reference Engine: The Universal Reference-First System

## Overview

Every domain has thousands of hours of professional engineering already completed. APIs have been designed, schemas have been refined, pipelines have been battle-tested, patterns have been hardened. Leveraging them as your reference is not laziness — it is engineering intelligence.

**Core principle:** Before building ANYTHING, locate the best existing reference. Extract its patterns. Build on proven foundations, not assumptions.

**No exceptions. No workarounds. No shortcuts.**

## The Prime Directive

```
NO BUILDING WITHOUT A REFERENCE
```

If you have not searched for proven references in the domain you are working in, you are disregarding thousands of hours of professional engineering. A payment API should resemble Stripe's API patterns, not a generic AI-generated endpoint.

## When to Use

**Always.** This protocol is the router. It determines WHICH reference system to engage based on what is being built.

```dot
digraph reference_router {
    rankdir=TB;
    node [shape=box style=filled];

    task [label="Task Received" fillcolor=lightyellow shape=doublecircle];

    classify [label="Classify Task Domain" fillcolor=lightyellow];

}
```

**Green nodes** = dedicated protocol exists, invoke it.
**Orange nodes** = use reference libraries from THIS protocol.
**Red nodes** = no reference exists yet — research first, then build.

## The Entry Protocol

```
BEFORE building anything:

1. CLASSIFY: What domain is this task in?
2. ROUTE: Does a dedicated reference protocol exist? (ux-patterns, design-research, github-search, codebase-research, etc.)
   -> YES: Invoke that protocol
   -> NO: Continue to step 3
3. SEARCH: Locate reference implementations for this domain
   - External: Use github-search for open-source repos, libraries, and patterns
   - Internal: Use codebase-research for existing conventions and similar code
   - GitHub: Search for gold-standard implementations
   - Documentation: Find official best practices (RFC specs, framework docs, cloud provider guides)
   - Industry leaders: What do Stripe, GitHub, Vercel, AWS do for this?
4. EXTRACT: Isolate the patterns that make these references excellent
5. PRESENT: Show the user your references and recommended approach
6. BUILD: Implement using the reference

Skip any step = building from assumptions instead of knowledge
```

## The Reference Philosophy

```
"Accumulated Expertise" Principle:

Every professional implementation represents:
- Months of design iteration
- Thousands of users providing feedback
- Production incidents that drove improvements
- Security audits that uncovered vulnerabilities
- Performance tuning under real load

When you generate from scratch, you inherit NONE of this.
When you use a reference, you inherit ALL of it.
```

## Domain Reference Libraries

### API Design References

**Gold-standard implementations to study:**

| API Style | Reference | Study For |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| REST | Stripe API | Resource naming, versioning, error format, pagination, idempotency |
| REST | GitHub API v3 | Hypermedia, conditional requests, rate limiting headers |
| REST | Twilio API | Nested resources, webhooks, status callbacks |

**API Reference Checklist:**

```
BEFORE designing any API:

1. Resource naming: Use nouns, plural, lowercase
   Reference: Stripe -> /v1/customers, /v1/payment_intents

2. Error format: Consistent error object
   Reference: Stripe -> { error: { type, code, message, param } }

3. Pagination: Cursor-based for real-time data, offset for static
   Reference: GitHub -> Link headers + per_page + page params
   Reference: Stripe -> has_more + starting_after cursor

4. Versioning: URL path or header
   Reference: Stripe -> /v1/ prefix
   Reference: GitHub -> Accept header with version

5. Auth: API keys for server, OAuth for users
   Reference: Stripe -> Bearer token in Authorization header

6. Rate limiting: Return limits in headers
   Reference: GitHub -> X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset

7. Idempotency: Idempotency keys for mutations
   Reference: Stripe -> Idempotency-Key header

8. Filtering/sorting: Consistent query parameter patterns
   Reference: Stripe -> created[gte]=timestamp, status=active
```

### Database Schema References

| Inventory | Products -> Warehouses -> Stock -> Movements | Odoo inventory module |

**Schema Reference Checklist:**

```
BEFORE designing any database schema:

1. Find the domain pattern above (or search GitHub for "[domain] database schema")
2. Study the reference implementation's:
   - Table relationships and foreign keys
   - Indexing strategy
   - Soft delete approach (deleted_at vs status)
   - Audit trail pattern (created_at, updated_at, created_by)
   - Multi-tenancy approach (row-level vs schema-level)
3. Standard columns for EVERY table:
   - id (UUID or ULID, not auto-increment for distributed systems)
   - created_at (timestamp with timezone)
   - updated_at (timestamp with timezone)
4. Naming convention: snake_case for tables and columns
5. Junction tables: {table_a}_{table_b} alphabetically
```

### Testing Strategy References

**Reference frameworks by project type:**

| Project Type | Testing Approach | Tools |
|-------------|------------------|-------|

| Mobile | Component -> Screen -> E2E | Detox (RN), XCTest (iOS), Espresso (Android) |
| Data Pipeline | Unit -> Integration -> Data quality | Great Expectations, dbt tests |
| Infrastructure | Plan -> Apply -> Verify | Terratest, kitchen-terraform |

**Testing Reference Checklist:**

```
BEFORE writing tests:

1. Identify project type -> select testing approach above
2. Test pyramid for this project:
   - Unit tests: 70% (fast, isolated, mock dependencies)
   - Integration tests: 20% (real dependencies, test interactions)
   - E2E tests: 10% (user flows, critical paths only)
3. What to test:
   - Happy path (minimum viable test)
   - Edge cases from spec (empty, null, max, concurrent)
   - Error paths (invalid input, network failure, timeout)
   - Security paths (injection, auth bypass, privilege escalation)
4. What NOT to test:
   - Framework internals (React renders correctly)
   - Third-party library behavior (axios sends requests)
   - Implementation details (internal state shape)
5. Test naming: describe("[unit]", () => it("should [behavior] when [condition]"))
6. Test data: Use factories/fixtures, not inline magic values

## The Research Process

When no specific reference library above covers your domain:

```
1. GitHub Search:
   - "[domain] [language] example" (e.g., "payment processing typescript example")
   - "[domain] boilerplate" or "[domain] starter"
   - Sort by stars, filter to recently updated

2. Official Documentation:
   - Framework guides (Next.js docs, Django docs, Rails guides)
   - Cloud provider best practices (AWS Well-Architected, GCP Architecture Center)
   - RFC specifications (for protocols, standards)

3. Industry Leaders:
   - What does Stripe do for payments?
   - What does GitHub do for API design?
   - What does Vercel do for deployment?
   - What does Cloudflare do for edge computing?

4. Open Source Implementations:
   - Search for mature, well-maintained projects in the same domain
   - Examine how they structure their code
   - Cherry-pick patterns from 3+ implementations
```

## Multi-Reference Cherry-Picking

The best results come from combining references from multiple sources:

```
Example: Building a SaaS billing system

Reference 1 (Stripe API patterns):
  -> Take: Resource naming, error format, idempotency
  -> Take: Webhook event structure and signing

Reference 2 (Lago open-source billing):
  -> Take: Usage-based metering data model
  -> Take: Invoice generation pipeline

Reference 3 (Supabase auth schema):
  -> Take: Multi-tenant organization structure
  -> Take: Row-level security patterns

Reference 4 (Cal.com):
  -> Take: Subscription lifecycle state machine
  -> Take: Webhook delivery with retry logic

Result: A billing system built on patterns from 4 production-tested systems,
each designed by teams who spent months on exactly these problems.
```

## Reference Quality Criteria

Not all references are equal. Evaluate by:

| Criterion | Weight | What to Check |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Production usage | High | Is this deployed in production by real organizations? |
| Community size | High | Stars, contributors, download counts |
| Maintenance | High | Recent commits, responsive issue handling |
| Documentation | Medium | Are patterns documented and explained? |
| Test coverage | Medium | Does the reference have strong tests? |
| Security audited | Medium | Has it passed security review? |
| Simplicity | Medium | Is the pattern minimal and clear? |
| Portability | Low | Can the pattern be adapted to other stacks? |

## Cognitive Traps

| Rationalization | Truth |
|-----------------|-------|
| "I know how to build this" | You know how to build A version. References give you the BEST version. |
| "This is too simple for a reference" | Simple things done wrong compound. A bad schema pattern affects every query forever. |
| "I'll consult references later" | Research FIRST. Structural decisions made early are hardest to reverse. |
| "The user didn't request research" | They requested quality. References ARE how you deliver quality. |
| "There's no reference for this" | There is always a reference. Adjacent domains, similar patterns, analogous systems. |
| "References slow me down" | Building the wrong thing slows you down MORE. |
| "I can improve on the reference" | Prove it. Show the reference first, then propose improvements. |
| "AI can generate strong patterns" | AI generates plausible patterns. Plausible does not mean production-tested. |

## Guardrails

**Prohibited:**
- Generating API designs without studying Stripe/GitHub/Twilio patterns
- Creating database schemas without locating domain-specific references
- Setting up CI/CD without examining starter workflows
- Implementing security without studying auth library patterns
- Writing tests without a testing strategy reference
- Choosing architecture without studying reference architectures

**Mandatory:**
- Locate at least 2 reference implementations before building
- Cherry-pick from 3+ sources for complex systems
- Present your references and approach to the user
- Explain WHY you chose specific patterns from specific references
- Update references when you discover superior ones
