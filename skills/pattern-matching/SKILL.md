description: Use when contributing code to an existing project - guarantees that every new line mirrors the established conventions, naming schemes, architectural layering, directory layout, and stylistic choices already present in the codebase rather than drifting toward generic AI defaults

# Pattern Matching

## Overview

Every codebase has a fingerprint. Your job is to replicate that fingerprint so precisely that no reviewer can tell where the original ends and your contribution begins.

**Core principle:** Observe before you act. Every function, file, and folder you produce must have a living precedent somewhere in the repository. If you cannot point to the model you followed, you have already introduced drift.

**No exceptions. No workarounds. No shortcuts.**

## The Prime Directive

```
EVERY ADDITION MUST MIRROR AN EXISTING PRECEDENT
```

When the repository favors `snake_case`, you write `snake_case`. When services live under `src/domain/`, your service lands there too. When errors propagate through a custom `Result<T>` type, you adopt it without question. There is no room for personal preference.

## When to Use

**Mandatory in these situations:**
- Touching any file in a pre-existing repository
- Introducing new modules, routes, or components into an established architecture
- Contributing features to a project you did not originate
- Performing refactors that reshape existing logic

**Unnecessary when:**
- Bootstrapping a greenfield project (see ascension:project-bootstrap)
- Writing disposable scripts that will never enter version control

## The Entry Protocol

```
BEFORE producing any code in an existing repository:

1. SURVEY: Locate 2-3 files or functions that solve a comparable problem
2. CATALOG: Record every convention they share
   - Identifier formatting (camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase)
   - Directory taxonomy (where do peers of this file reside?)
   - Import conventions (relative paths, aliases, barrel files)
   - Error propagation strategy (exceptions, Result types, error codes)
   - State access patterns (global store, context injection, parameter passing)
   - Test co-location and framework choices
3. REPLICATE: Produce your code using the identical conventions
4. AUDIT: Hold your output beside the originals — does it pass as native?

Omit any step = drift introduced
```

## Dimensions of Conformity

### File-Level Conventions

```
BEFORE placing a new file:

1. Where do its siblings reside? (directory hierarchy)
2. How are filenames formed? (kebab-case.ts, PascalCase.tsx, snake_case.py)
3. What internal structure does each file follow? (imports, types, constants, logic, exports)
4. How are exports surfaced? (default export, named exports, re-export indexes)
```

### Function-Level Conventions

```
BEFORE writing a new function, class, or component:

1. Identify an existing function that addresses a similar concern
2. Mirror its shape:
   - Argument style (destructured object vs positional args)
   - Return envelope (Promise<T>, Result<T, E>, nullable)
   - Error strategy (try/catch, .catch(), explicit error returns)
   - Observability (logger.info(), structured JSON, console methods)
   - Validation technique (Zod, Joi, manual guards, type narrowing)
3. Rely on the SAME libraries and utilities the project already depends on
   - Do not introduce ramda if the project uses native array methods
   - Do not pull in got if the project wraps fetch
   - Do not add a competing ORM when one is already wired in
```

### Architecture-Level Conventions

```
BEFORE inserting a new module or layer:

1. How is the codebase stratified?
   - Routes -> Controllers -> Services -> Repositories?
   - Pages -> Components -> Hooks -> Helpers?
   - Handlers -> Domain -> Infrastructure?
2. Which way do imports flow?
3. Where does business logic concentrate?
4. How do cross-cutting concerns surface? (auth middleware, logging wrappers, error boundaries)
```

## The Shadowing Method

The fastest route to conformity: locate the nearest relative and shadow it stroke for stroke.

```
1. LOCATE: "Find the file most similar to what I need to create"
2. STUDY: Absorb its structure, imports, error handling, naming, export style
3. DUPLICATE: Use it as a skeleton
4. SPECIALIZE: Swap in only the logic unique to your feature
5. COMPARE: Place them side by side — can you spot the newcomer?
```

**Effective prompting pattern:**
```
"Here is our existing payment service (src/services/payment.ts).
Produce the new subscription service using identical structure, patterns, and naming."
```

Showing a concrete example always outperforms describing rules in prose.

## Typical Divergence Patterns

| AI Tendency | Project Convention | Correction |
|---|---|---|
| `console.log()` | Structured logger via `winston` | Adopt the project's logging pipeline |
| Generic `try/catch` | Domain-specific `ServiceError` class | Throw and catch using the project's error hierarchy |
| Inline Tailwind classes | CSS Modules / styled-components | Follow the project's styling methodology |
| `axios` for HTTP | Custom `fetch` wrapper in `lib/http` | Use the wrapper the team built |
| New helper functions | Existing utility belt in `utils/` | Audit `utils/` before creating anything new |
| Flat file layout | Feature-folder nesting | Respect the existing directory blueprint |
| Default exports | Named exports throughout | Align with the repository's export convention |
| Loose `any` types | Strict TypeScript with generics | Match the project's type discipline |
| `let` declarations | `const` by default | Mirror the existing variable declaration habit |
| Raw SQL strings | ORM query builder | Use the project's data access layer |

## Pre-Commit Verification

Before finalizing, confirm:

- [ ] File resides in the appropriate directory (same neighborhood as its peers)
- [ ] Filename obeys the prevailing naming scheme
- [ ] Import order and alias usage match the established style
- [ ] All identifiers (variables, functions, types) follow existing naming rules
- [ ] Error handling echoes the repository's standard pattern
- [ ] No new dependency duplicates an existing one
- [ ] Tests adhere to the same framework, structure, and naming as existing tests
- [ ] Logging channels through the project's logger
- [ ] The code reads as though the original author wrote it

## Cognitive Traps

| Rationalization | Truth |
|---|---|
| "My approach is objectively superior" | Uniformity outweighs individual taste. Conform to the codebase. |
| "This is a more contemporary technique" | Modern does not mean appropriate for THIS repository. Match the existing reality. |
| "It is only a single file" | One divergent file sets a precedent for ten more. Entropy compounds. |
| "I will harmonize everything later" | You will not. Partial migration is more damaging than consistent legacy. |
| "The current pattern is flawed" | Raise it with the human first. Unilateral convention changes are forbidden. |
| "This dependency is demonstrably better" | Better in isolation does not justify duplication. The project already solved this. |

## Guardrails

**Prohibited actions:**
- Importing a library that overlaps with one already in use
- Applying a naming convention alien to the codebase
- Placing a file where it violates the existing directory structure
- Altering an established convention without explicit human approval
- Writing code that is visually distinguishable from its neighbors

**Required actions:**
- Examine 2-3 analogous files before writing anything
- Exhaust the project's existing utilities before inventing new ones
- Reproduce error handling, logging, and validation patterns verbatim
- Seek permission before deviating ("The codebase uses X. Shall I continue with X or migrate to Y?")
